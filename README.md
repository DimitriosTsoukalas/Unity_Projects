Ending notes: Feel free to ask for the files of the game. I would be more than happy to share. Due to the volume of those, I was unable to simply upload them in GitHub. Also, apologies if the quality of the video is poor, that is mostly because of my machine but I do hope you will appreciate the effort :D.

Thank you for your time! I really hope you enjoy!
