## Project A
This is a small challenge that is going to test your attention to small details. It contains different elements that I have learned via Unity (e.g. particles, VFX and more) while it is kinda fun at the same time.

## Project B
This is a much bigger project that contains the foundations of an RPG game. The game dives directly into a small adventure where the player has to find some things / has to reach some points. It is a very straightforward game that includes various elements such as: dialogue system, combat system, shopping system, inventory system, scene management, camera management and more.

## Project C
This is an FPS Project, using UPR 3D scene in Unity. Some things that the player can do is 1). Move 2). Jump 3). Run 4). Crouch 5). Zoom
6). Interact when looking or when clicking.

## Project D
This is a simple platform game that demonstrates some basic concepts such as: 1). Moving 2). Jumping / Double Jumping 3). Weapon Swinging / Killing Enemies 4). Wall Sliding 5). Wall Jumping 6). Enemy cone of view 7). Enemy jumping on you 8). Enemy firing on you 9). Enemy evading you. 10). Cinemachine

Ending notes: Feel free to ask for the files of the game. I would be more than happy to share. Due to the volume of those, I was unable to simply upload them in GitHub. Also, apologies if the quality of the video is poor, that is mostly because of my machine but I do hope you will appreciate the effort :D. To download any of the videos, click on the Project-D-The-Platform-v.0.1.avi file that you can see above and then click on the "View raw" that you can see in your sreen.

Thank you for your time and enjoy coding !
